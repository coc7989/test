Setting up a bsub-smart wrapper in your IBM LSF environment is very feasible — and it can significantly improve cluster efficiency without sacrificing flexibility or performance.

Below is a step-by-step guide to help you set up a basic version of bsub-smart, which:

Analyzes past job history of a user (via bacct).

Estimates "reasonable" CPU and memory needs.

Automatically adjusts -n and -R options for under- or over-requested jobs.

Allows override if needed.

✅ Step-by-Step: Setting Up bsub-smart
🔧 1. Create a Wrapper Script
You can place this in a shared directory like /opt/lsf/utils/bsub-smart or under users' home or /usr/local/bin.

Here’s a basic prototype in Bash:

bash
Copy
Edit
#!/bin/bash

# bsub-smart: A smart wrapper for bsub based on job history
# Usage: bsub-smart [options] script.sh

USER=$(whoami)
CMD="$*"
DEFAULT_CPUS=4
DEFAULT_MEM=4096   # in MB

# Optional: Accept override
USE_AUTO=true
while [[ "$1" == --* ]]; do
    case "$1" in
        --fixed) USE_AUTO=false ;;
        --adaptive) USE_AUTO=true ;;
        *) echo "Unknown option: $1"; exit 1 ;;
    esac
    shift
done

# Path to the job script
SCRIPT="$1"

# Estimate resources based on past jobs
if $USE_AUTO; then
    echo "[bsub-smart] Checking past usage for user: $USER..."

    JOB_STATS=$(bacct -u "$USER" -d 3 | grep "Resources" | tail -n 10)

    USED_CPUS=$(echo "$JOB_STATS" | awk '{sum += $6} END {if (NR>0) print int(sum/NR); else print 0}')
    USED_MEM=$(echo "$JOB_STATS" | awk '{sum += $7} END {if (NR>0) print int(sum/NR); else print 0}')

    CPUS=${USED_CPUS:-$DEFAULT_CPUS}
    MEM_MB=${USED_MEM:-$DEFAULT_MEM}

    # Add 25% safety margin
    CPUS=$((CPUS + (CPUS / 4)))
    MEM_MB=$((MEM_MB + (MEM_MB / 4)))

    echo "[bsub-smart] Submitting with: -n $CPUS -R \"rusage[mem=${MEM_MB}]\""
    bsub -n "$CPUS" -R "rusage[mem=${MEM_MB}]" "$SCRIPT"
else
    echo "[bsub-smart] Fixed mode — passing directly to bsub"
    bsub "$@"
fi
💡 Notes:
This script averages the last 10 jobs' CPU and memory usage.

Adds a 25% buffer to avoid under-allocation.

You can refine this using lsacct or more job metadata (e.g., job name, queue).

Make it executable:

bash
Copy
Edit
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bsub-smart
🛠️ 2. Test It
Run a sample job:

bash
Copy
Edit
bsub-smart --adaptive myjob.sh
Try fixed mode:

bash
Copy
Edit
bsub-smart --fixed -n 12 -R "rusage[mem=30720]" myjob.sh
🧠 3. Enhance (Optional)
Here are some enhancements you can implement:

Feature	Description
Job name pattern matching	Use job script name to refine history search
Percentile stats	Use 75th percentile instead of average
YAML/JSON config	Allow per-user or per-group defaults
Email user if job was underutilized	Educate users over time
Logging	Track decisions made by bsub-smart

🔒 4. Optional: Admin-Level Setup
If you're an LSF admin, you can:

Deploy to all users via PATH

Enforce as a default bsub alias:

bash
Copy
Edit
alias bsub='/usr/local/bin/bsub-smart'
⚠️ Only do this if the wrapper is thoroughly tested and allows manual overrides (--fixed mode).

✅ 1. Integrate Efficiency Metrics into User Dashboards
Most teams care about their:

Turnaround times

Tool success rates

Queue wait times

So, show them a dashboard (or send a weekly report to managers) like:

“Your team’s average CPU efficiency this week: 28%
Other teams in your group: 76%
Jobs waiting longer than expected due to overrequesting: 132”

This motivates team leads to take action, not individual users.

Tools: Grafana + LSF job data → dashboards; custom reporting scripts.

✅ 2. Make Job Efficiency Part of Resource Allocation or Priority
This one’s powerful:

Use LSF fairshare or priority decay:

Users or groups with chronic inefficiency get lower scheduling priority.

Teams with high efficiency get faster turnaround.

This creates a feedback loop:

“If you keep overrequesting, your jobs will take longer to run.”

No email needed — the behavior is felt directly.

✅ 3. Report to Engineering/CAD/IT Managers, Not Just Users
Individual users often don’t care. But their team leads or managers do, especially when:

They’re being compared to other teams.

Their job throughput or SLA is impacted.

Send job efficiency summaries weekly to managers:

“Team Alpha: 22% CPU efficiency, 400 core-hours wasted
Team Beta: 80% efficiency — great!”

Managers will pressure teams to fix it.
