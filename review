You're on the right track. What you're thinking of falls under predictive operations in HPC/LSF environments, and these kinds of insights can significantly improve scheduling efficiency, resource usage, and user productivity.

Here‚Äôs a structured breakdown of how you can approach predictive operations in IBM LSF to achieve your goals:


---

üß† Predictive Ops in IBM LSF ‚Äî Opportunities

1. Classifying Job Types (Long-running / Short-running / Inefficient)

Goal: Tag or predict job categories before or early in execution.

üîß How:

Feature Engineering: Collect data like:

Submission time

Job name / executable

User or group

Queue

Requested resources (CPU, memory, duration)

Historical run times for similar jobs


ML Model: Use a classification model (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or even basic rule-based initially) to classify into:

Short

Long

Inefficient (e.g., high memory but low CPU utilization)




---

2. Detecting "Zombie" or Forgotten Jobs

Goal: Identify long-running jobs where the user is unaware (common with abandoned GUI sessions, stuck loops, etc.)

üîß How:

Define thresholds:

Based on job type, expected vs. actual runtime


Monitor for:

Lack of stdout/stderr updates

No checkpointing or file I/O over X hours

Low resource utilization over a long period


Use alerting or automatic tagging


> Bonus: Integrate with user notification system or Slack/Email alerts.




---

3. Predicting Job Completion Time

Goal: Forecast when a running job will complete to improve scheduling and user planning.

üîß How:

Historical job data + current progress metrics (if job supports progress reporting)

Features:

Job name/type

Submission/request parameters

Real-time CPU/memory/IO usage

Checkpoint/progress log parsing (if available)


Approaches:

Regression models (e.g., XGBoost Regressor)

Time-series analysis

Compare against similar completed jobs ("nearest neighbor" matching)



> Bonus: Give ETA to users or visualize it in dashboards.

üî® Implementation Strategy

üì• Data Collection

Pull job data via bhist, bjobs, bacct, lsload, etc.

Store in a central DB (e.g., PostgreSQL or even just CSVs for prototype)

Schedule regular jobs to collect this info


üìä Dashboard & Monitoring (Optional)

Use Grafana/Prometheus for visual real-time monitoring

Jupyter + Matplotlib/Plotly for exploratory work

Alerting via email/Slack


üì¶ Tech Stack Ideas

Backend: Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, etc.)

Data Store: PostgreSQL / SQLite / CSV (start simple)

Optional Dashboards: Flask/Django + JS + Grafana



---

‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges & Considerations

Data Quality: Inconsistent job naming, missing logs, or variable runtimes

Privacy: Respect user data (especially for design teams)

Integration: LSF APIs and user communication mechanisms

Resource Utilization Metrics: Need tools like lsfmon, lsload, or OS metrics



---

‚úÖ Example: Simple MVP for Classification

Goal: Predict job type before submission.

Steps:

1. Collect historical job logs (bjobs -l, bacct, etc.)


2. Label jobs by runtime buckets (e.g., <10min, 10min‚Äì1hr, >1hr)


3. Train a simple classifier (Random Forest)


4. Integrate into submission wrapper script to predict and warn user
