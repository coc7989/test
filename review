tTo implement your IBM LSF job management logic — where users who have exhausted their job limits get their pending jobs moved to a "flexi" queue — we can approach this by creating a monitoring and control script. This script would periodically (e.g., via cron or a persistent daemon) check job statuses and take action accordingly.

Here's a structured design for implementing this in IBM LSF:


---

🧠 Design Plan for Auto-Moving Jobs to Flexi Queue in LSF


---

✅ Problem Overview

You want to:

1. Detect if a user has hit their job slot or resource usage limit.


2. Check if the user has pending jobs (PEND status).


3. Move those pending jobs to a less restrictive queue (e.g., flexi queue).




---

1. Key LSF Concepts to Use

bjobs: Get job info including status, queue, reason for pending.

bqueues: Get queue configuration (limits).

lsload / bhosts: To know current load/resources per host.

bacct or bhist: For accounting/user historical usage.

bmod: To modify a job (e.g., change its queue).

lsadmin / badmin: For cluster or admin-level status.



---

2. Assumptions

There's a soft or hard limit per user defined via:

Queue-level limits (USER_SHARES, USER_JOB_LIMIT, RUN limits).

Fairshare or SLA policies.


The flexi queue is:

Less restrictive.

Can accept overflow jobs.

Has capacity to run additional jobs.




---

3. High-Level Algorithm

🔁 Periodic Script Loop (e.g., every 5–10 minutes):

A. Enumerate All Users with Pending Jobs

bjobs -u all -noheader -o "user stat" | awk '$2=="PEND"{print $1}' | sort | uniq

B. For Each User:

1. Check Running Job Count

bjobs -u $USER -noheader -o "stat" | grep -c RUN


2. Get User Limits (if applicable):

Could parse from bqueues, if queues have USER_JOB_LIMIT, etc.

Or assume static values configured in script.



3. Check If Limit Is Reached

If running jobs >= user’s job limit:

Proceed to step C.


Else: do nothing.




C. For User's Pending Jobs:

1. List all pending jobs for that user:

bjobs -u $USER -noheader -o "jobid stat queue" | awk '$2=="PEND"{print $1, $3}'


2. Filter only those not already in the flexi queue:

if queue != "flexi" → candidate for moving.



3. Use bmod to move them to flexi:

bmod -q flexi <jobid>




---

4. Script Sample (Pseudo Bash/Python Hybrid)

Here’s a rough Bash logic to demonstrate the key parts:

#!/bin/bash

USER_JOB_LIMIT=50  # Or fetch dynamically

for user in $(bjobs -u all -noheader -o "user stat" | awk '$2=="PEND"{print $1}' | sort | uniq); do
    RUNNING=$(bjobs -u $user -noheader -o "stat" | grep -c RUN)
    if [ "$RUNNING" -ge "$USER_JOB_LIMIT" ]; then
        echo "User $user has $RUNNING running jobs. Moving pending jobs to flexi queue."
        for jobid in $(bjobs -u $user -noheader -o "jobid stat queue" | awk '$2=="PEND" && $3!="flexi"{print $1}'); do
            echo "  Moving job $jobid to flexi queue"
            bmod -q flexi $jobid
        done
    fi
done


---

5. Additional Checks to Add (Highly Recommended)

Check Type	Description

🧭 Job Age	Only move jobs pending for >X minutes
⛔ PEND Reason	bjobs -l shows reasons like “Not enough resources”, “User job limit”, etc. Only move if relevant
🛡️ Job Type Filter	You may skip interactive jobs or certain project tags
🔐 User Whitelist	You may want to restrict this to certain users/groups
🔁 Avoid Thrashing	Prevent jobs from bouncing back and forth queues
📝 Logging	Keep audit logs of which jobs were moved, when, and why



---

6. Deployment Plan

1. Test on One User: Hardcode a user and run script manually.


2. Audit Logging: Add logging before production use.


3. Add as Cronjob:

*/10 * * * * /path/to/move_to_flexi.sh >> /var/log/lsf-flexi.log 2>&1




---

7. Scaling Up

Consider writing in Python or Go for performance/logging/control.

Use LSF Python API (lsfPy or wrappers) if preferred.

Store user limits in config file or environment variables.



---

✅ Summary of Core Checks

Step	Check

1	User has PEND jobs
2	User has RUNNING jobs >= limit
3	Job is NOT already in flexi
4	Job is eligible (age, reason)
5	Modify job: bmod -q flexi <job>

Would you like a production-ready Python version of the script, or integration with monitoring tools like Grafana or Slack alerts as well?
