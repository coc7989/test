Thanks for sharing the bjobs -l output ‚Äî it's very informative. Here's a breakdown of why your job (500284) in the gui queue is pending, and what it means:


---

üîç Summary of Pending Reasons

> Candidate host pending reasons (0 of 712 hosts)



This means zero hosts are currently eligible to run your job.


---

üßæ Detailed Reasons from Non-Candidate Hosts (712 total):

Reason	Host Count	What It Means

Not specified in job submission	593 hosts	These hosts are excluded because your job request did not match their requirements. Possibly due to a -m (host model), queue-specific resource restrictions, or host groups not being matched.
Load threshold reached (Resource: mem)	45 hosts	These hosts are currently too busy (memory usage too high) to accept new jobs.
Closed by LSF administrator	31 hosts	These hosts are manually disabled or closed for maintenance or policy reasons.
Load information unavailable	22 hosts	LSF cannot currently determine load on these hosts ‚Äî often network or daemon issues.
Job's resource requirements not satisfied	20 hosts	Your job's requested resources (like rusage[mem=], GPU, etc.) don't match what's available on these hosts.
Unable to reach batch server	1 host	Possibly a temporary network issue or host down.

üöß Root Cause Summary

Your job is pending because no host satisfies all its requirements at the moment.

Most likely causes:

Too many hosts excluded due to no specific model/resource match

Memory usage too high on otherwise valid hosts

Some hosts are down, under maintenance, or unreachable

No host currently meets your resource request

üõ†Ô∏è What You Can Do

1. Check if you requested specific host/model
If you used -m or -R "select[...] in your submission, try removing or relaxing that.


2. Reduce memory request
If you used something like rusage[mem=8192], try lowering it if feasible.


3. Try again later
Since some hosts are blocked due to high load, the job may run when resources free up.


4. Check with admins if it stays pending too long
Especially if you didn't request anything special ‚Äî they may need to free up resources or check host group assignments.
