yPerfect — that simplifies things and gives us more flexibility to make the design robust and clean.

Let's now lay down a refined and structured plan based on your intent:


---

✅ Your Clarifications Recapped

❌ Drop the “small job to mt host” intelligence for now — may revisit later.

✅ Always prioritize jobs based on config-defined project and user lists.

❗ Other rules: You’ve just brainstormed them — it's now my job to analyze, refine, and order them smartly.

✅ You want flexibility via flags to enable/disable each intelligence.

✅ Default behavior: all intelligences enabled unless turned off explicitly.

🧠 Clean, Refined Intelligence Rule Architecture

Let’s now define the core intelligence rules, prune redundancy, order them smartly, and categorize clearly.


---

🎯 Phase 1: Strict Eligibility Filters (must pass)

These are the minimum required checks before a job can even be considered.

Rule	Logic	Always On?

User quota hit	user.running_slots == user.quota and user.pending_slots > 0	✅ Yes
Cluster has capacity	available_slots > buffer_threshold	✅ Yes
Job is pending	Job in PEND state	✅ Yes



---

🏆 Phase 2: Priority Boosters

These are used to rank eligible jobs, using a scoring system.

Priority	Rule	Description	Default Score

🔶 1	Project config priority	If job’s project is in high-priority config	+30
🔶 2	User config priority	If job’s owner is in priority user list	+25
3	Low user quota	Users with smaller quotas get more boost	up to +15
4	Job pending age	Older pending jobs get higher score	up to +20
5	User recent utilization	Users with lower usage in last 6 hours are prioritized	up to +15
6	Job completion history	If similar jobs from user were short/efficient, prioritize	up to +10
7	Longest pending job in system	Extra bonus if user has one of the oldest jobs	+5


🔧 Each rule is toggleable via CLI flags.


---

🔄 Phase 3: Tie-breakers (When Scores Match)

Rule	Logic

Round-robin per user	One job per user in cycles
Oldest job wins	Within user, pick oldest pending job



---

🧰 Config Structure

# config/user_priority.yaml
priority_users:
  - alice
  - bob

# config/project_priority.yaml
priority_projects:
  - critical_chip
  - bugfix_hotpath

🧩 Key Components

Module	Purpose

cluster_fetcher.py	Wraps bjobs, bhosts, bqueues, etc.
scoring_engine.py	Applies score to each eligible job
config_loader.py	Loads user/project config
placement.py	Applies tie-breakers, round-robin
history_tracker.py	Avoids remigrating same job repeatedly



---

🛠️ CLI Usage

python move_jobs.py --dry-run --disable job_history_check --disable utilization_check

Flags Supported:

--dry-run

--disable project_priority

--disable user_priority

--disable quota_sort

--disable pending_age

--disable utilization_check

--disable completion_history

--disable long_pending_bonus



---

🔄 Control Flow Summary

[1] Fetch cluster/job state
[2] Filter eligible jobs
[3] Load config: priority users/projects
[4] Score each eligible job
[5] Sort jobs by score
[6] Resolve ties with round-robin
[7] Move jobs to flexi queue (unless dry-run)
[8] Log + update history


---

🧠 Suggestions for Future (Optional)

Add a web dashboard showing current quota usage, job age, flexi queue state.

Add alerting when flexi queue is overloaded or rule conflicts arise.

Use SQLite to track all migrations for analysis & rollback if needed.

Shall I now move forward and begin coding this system starting with the scaffolding (CLI, config loader, data fetcher)? Or would you like to discuss any specific rule or component first?
