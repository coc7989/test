rThat's a great use case and a common challenge in shared HPC environments like those managed with IBM LSF. You want to ensure fair usage, maximize farm utilization, and prevent job starvation ‚Äî all at once.

‚úÖ Your Objective Recap:

Check if user A has pending jobs because they hit their quota.

If farm has free capacity, move some of those jobs to a flexi queue.

But: be fair ‚Äî don't favor just one user, and avoid overwhelming the flexi queue.

So: introduce an intelligent rule to decide whose and how many jobs get moved.

üéØ Smart Intelligence Mechanism: Hybrid Fairness + Opportunity Rule

Let‚Äôs break it down.

üîπ Rule Components

1. User Quota Check:

Each user has a configured quota (say, 100 slots).

If user.pending_slots > 0 and user.running_slots == user.quota, they are a candidate.



2. Cluster Free Capacity:

available_slots = total_slots - total_running_slots

Only proceed if available_slots > buffer_threshold (e.g., 10% of total capacity).



3. Global Fair Share Weight (Recommended):

Keep a moving average of how many slots each user has consumed over the past N hours/days.

Avoid pushing users who already used a disproportionately high share.



4. Pending Job Age Priority:

Pick oldest jobs first ‚Äî helps avoid starvation.



5. Flexi Queue Cap:

Don‚Äôt overload the flexi queue ‚Äî define a per-user limit and a global one.



6. Round-Robin Allocation:

If multiple users are eligible, pick 1 job per user in a round-robin manner.

This avoids favoring a single heavy user.

üß† Final Rule Logic (Pseudocode Style)

For each user:
    if user has pending jobs AND user is at quota:
        if cluster has spare capacity:
            if user has not exceeded recent usage threshold:
                add user to eligible list

While available_slots > 0 and flexi_queue not full:
    For each eligible user (round-robin):
        Pick their oldest pending job
        Move to flexi queue
        Update available_slots, user's moved job count

‚öñÔ∏è Optional Enhancements

FairShare with Decay: Give credits to users who waited long without getting jobs.

Dynamic User Limits: Increase flexi quota for users who were recently penalized due to high farm load.

Time-based rules: Relax limits more aggressively at night or weekends when farm load is typically lower.

üõ† Metrics You'll Need in Script

bqueues, bjobs, busers or lsload output for:

Job state, user, queue

User quota usage

System load & slots available


Tracking DB or file (optional) to maintain:

Per-user job usage history

Fair-share credits

Jobs recently moved
