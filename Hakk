rThis block from the sudoers file defines a command alias named LSF_RECONFIG_CMDS and lists a set of commands that users or groups can be allowed to run with sudo privileges.

Here's a breakdown of what's happening:


---

Cmnd_Alias definition:

Cmnd_Alias LSF_RECONFIG_CMDS = /apps/lsf/10.1/.../lsadmin ckconfig -v, ...

Cmnd_Alias is a directive in the sudoers file used to group commands under a single alias for cleaner and more maintainable rules.

LSF_RECONFIG_CMDS is the name of this alias.

The list following it includes specific command-line executions, mostly related to LSF (Load Sharing Facility) utilities, across two different base directories:

/apps/lsf/10.1/... (likely the production path)

/apps/lsftest/10.1/... (likely a test/staging path)


Each command includes both the path and specific arguments (e.g., ckconfig -v, reconfig -v, etc.).



---

Noteworthy part:

/bin/bash -c *

This is a very broad and risky entry. It allows execution of any command passed via /bin/bash -c, which defeats the purpose of fine-grained command control and could lead to security concerns. It essentially allows a user to run arbitrary commands with sudo, bypassing restrictions.



---

About replicating it to other regions:

Yes, you can replicate this block if:

The LSF version and directory structure (/apps/lsf/10.1/...) are the same across regions.

The same set of LSF admin actions are needed in those regions.


Caution:

Do not replicate /bin/bash -c * unless there's a clear reason and you're fully aware of the security implications. It essentially negates all command restrictions in this alias.

It’s best to remove or replace that line with more specific allowed scripts or commands if possible.

Would you like help refactoring this block to be more secure or tailored for a different region?

Great question — you can absolutely still parse the output and status code separately in your Jenkins pipeline when using a script.

Here's how to adjust both your script and Jenkins pipeline to make it easy and clean:


---

1. Modified Shell Script: /opt/scripts/lsf_ckconfig.sh

Ensure the script prints the output first, then the status code in a parseable format:

#!/bin/bash
. /data/lsf/conf/profile.lsf
BADMIN=$(which badmin)
output=$($BADMIN ckconfig -v 2>&1)
status=$?
echo "$output"
echo "LSF_CMD_STATUS_CODE=$status"

Make it executable:

chmod 755 /opt/scripts/lsf_ckconfig.sh


---

2. Jenkins Pipeline Groovy Snippet

Here’s how you parse the output and status code cleanly:

def rawOutput = sh(
    script: """ssh ${masterServer} '/data/sudo/bin/sudo -u lsfadmin /opt/scripts/lsf_ckconfig.sh'""",
    returnStdout: true
).trim()

// Split output into lines
def lines = rawOutput.readLines()

// Extract the status line and remove it from main output
def statusLine = lines[-1]
def commandOutput = lines[0..-2].join("\n")

// Extract the numeric status code
def statusCode = statusLine.replace("LSF_CMD_STATUS_CODE=", "").trim()

// Use `commandOutput` and `statusCode` as needed
println "LSF command output:\n${commandOutput}"
println "Status code: ${statusCode}"

if (statusCode != "0") {
    error("LSF command failed with status ${statusCode}")
}


---

Why this works well:

Keeps your sudoers file secure and minimal.

Separates output from exit status cleanly.

Your pipeline logic stays robust and readable.
