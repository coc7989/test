yYou're building a solid observability plan around IBM LSF, and tying it with Zabbix is a great idea for real-time monitoring. Below is a breakdown of each critical area, key metrics, explanations, and how to collect that data, ideally integrating with Zabbix or external scripts.


---

1. LSF Job Scheduler Health and Performance

Critical Areas and Metrics

a) Job throughput and queue delays

What it is: Measures how many jobs are being processed and how long jobs wait in the queue.

Metrics:

bjobs -p -o "pend_reason" – See why jobs are pending.

Job submission vs completion rate.


How to gather:

Script to parse bjobs output and count jobs per queue/user.

Monitor with Zabbix via a custom script using LSF CLI.



b) Number of cores (DPP 1hosts vs Non-DPP) vs OS type (ws70 vs ws80)

What it is: Helps compare job distribution and performance across hardware and OS types.

Metrics:

Cores available and used per host type.

Job slot usage categorized by OS type.


How to gather:

Use lsload, bhosts, and lsfhostgroup info.

Maintain a host mapping file (host -> DPP/OS type) and use Zabbix low-level discovery.



c) Scheduler daemon health (mbatchd, sbatchd)

What it is: Monitors if the LSF daemons are running, responsive, and healthy.

Metrics:

Live connection count.

CPU usage.

Process state (running, zombie).

Systemctl service status.


How to gather:

Use ps, top, or systemctl status.

Zabbix can monitor daemon state via a systemd check.

Use a user parameter to parse process CPU.



d) Identify queues/jobs backlogged/starved

What it is: Identifies queues with large numbers of jobs waiting due to no resources.

Metrics:

Number of jobs pending per queue.

Queues with long wait times.


How to gather:

Use bqueues, bjobs -p regularly.

Zabbix can collect queue-wise job stats with a script and custom items.



e) Job failure rates

What it is: Tracks how often jobs fail and patterns behind failures.

Metrics:

Exit codes of jobs.

Failure reasons from bhist -l or bacct.


How to gather:

Daily or hourly parsing of bacct -l or bhist -l by user/job ID.

Feed into Zabbix with an external script or scheduled cron job.

2. Compute Node Health & Utilization

Critical Areas and Metrics

a) Node availability and responsiveness

Metrics:

bhosts status.

sbatchd responsiveness.

Ping or SSH check.


How to gather:

Use bhosts and alert if a node is unavail.

Zabbix native agent can monitor host liveness.



b) Resource bottlenecks (CPU, memory, disk)

Metrics:

CPU load: top, uptime, lsload.

Memory usage: free, vmstat, top.

Disk I/O: iostat, df -h /tmp.


How to gather:

Zabbix agent can directly monitor CPU/memory/disk.

Extend with user parameters to fetch /tmp usage specifically.



c) Thermal or hardware issues

Metrics:

CPU temperatures (lm_sensors).

Disk health (SMART).

Hardware logs.


How to gather:

Use sensors, smartctl, or IPMI tools.

Zabbix templates exist for hardware health monitoring.

3. Cluster Resource Utilization

Critical Areas and Metrics

a) Underutilized/Overloaded resources

Metrics:

CPU core hours used vs. available.

Memory usage trends.

Slot usage.


How to gather:

lsload, bhosts, bacct to calculate usage over time.

Zabbix graphs + history.



b) Imbalanced workload distribution

What it is: Detect if some nodes are heavily used while others sit idle.

Metrics:

Per-node usage stats from lsload, bhosts.


How to gather:

Cron job to scan node load and submit to Zabbix.

Visualize via heatmaps or dashboards.



c) Decommissioning hosts

What it is: Identify hosts like ws40, ws60 that aren’t being used.

Metrics:

No jobs in last X days.

Always idle.


How to gather:

Use bacct, bhist, and create report of idle nodes.

Zabbix trend data can support long-term analysis.

4. User Behavior and Job Efficiency

Critical Areas and Metrics

a) Inefficient jobs and resource misuse

Metrics:

Job efficiency = CPU time / wallclock.

Memory requested vs. used.

Frequent failures or short-lived jobs.


How to gather:

Use bacct -l, bjobs -l, or bhist.

Export metrics to Zabbix per user/job group.



b) Zombie or orphan jobs

Metrics:

Jobs running with 0% CPU or memory.

Processes without parent LSF jobs.


How to gather:

Use ps scan + job-to-process matching script.

Cross-reference with bjobs.



c) Top N users by usage

Metrics:

Submissions.

CPU/memory consumption.

Failures per user.


How to gather:

Parse bacct, bjobs, or bhist.

Zabbix external script can aggregate by user and push stats.




---

Sssd Failures Note:

This is generally an infra issue. Monitor with:

journalctl -u sssd

Zabbix can have a log file or systemd watcher for it.



---

Integration with Zabbix

1. Use Zabbix agent (passive or active) on all nodes.


2. Create UserParameters for LSF-specific CLI queries.


3. Aggregate Metrics via cron jobs or scheduled scripts.


4. Use low-level discovery (LLD) to dynamically monitor compute nodes, queues, or user jobs.


5. Set triggers and thresholds for pending jobs, daemon CPU usage, etc.

Let me know if you’d like help writing Zabbix user parameter scripts or a dashboard template for any of these categories.
