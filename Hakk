yIn IBM LSF, the bhosts command shows the status of each host in the cluster. The STATUS field helps administrators understand the availability and readiness of each host for running jobs. Here's a breakdown of the most common statuses:


---

1. ok

Meaning: The host is available and functioning normally.

Jobs can be dispatched: Yes.



---

2. unavail

Meaning: The host is not responding to LSF daemons (e.g., res or sbatchd).

Possible causes:

Host is down.

LSF daemons have crashed or are stopped.

Network issues.


Jobs can be dispatched: No.



---

3. unreachable

Meaning: The host is powered on but cannot be reached by the master host.

Difference from unavail: Indicates a communication problem rather than a daemon failure.

Jobs can be dispatched: No.



---

4. closed

Meaning: The host is administratively closed to new jobs.

Set by: Admins or automatically by LSF policies.

Jobs can be dispatched: No new jobs; running jobs may continue.



---

5. busy

Meaning: The host is currently busy (e.g., high load or resource usage).

Trigger: Based on thresholds set in lsf.conf or host load thresholds.

Jobs can be dispatched: Usually no, unless configured otherwise.



---

Other statuses you might see:

full: Host has reached the max job limit.

locked: Host is locked for exclusive job use.

no_license: License unavailable for this host (in licensed environments).
