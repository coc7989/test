jTo address this problem, we'll design a CLI-based lightweight and scalable session manager called sessman for managing simulated user login sessions across 1000+ Linux VMs. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the design, architecture, and implementation approach:


---

1. System Architecture Overview

Session Manager (sessman CLI): Central tool to manage sessions.

Session Store: Persistent database (SQLite for simplicity, Redis for scalability).

VM Registry: Maintains a list of all VMs and their session loads.

Session Dispatcher: Assigns sessions to the least-loaded VM.

Background Load Balancer (Optional): Migrates sessions if VM load gets high.



---

2. Key Features and Design Decisions

a. Creating a Session

Check if user already has a session.

Find the VM with the least number of active sessions.

Create a pseudo session (simulate with a record, or sleep process if needed).

Assign a UUID as session ID and store metadata: username, VM, timestamp, status.


b. Listing Sessions

Paginated output using --page and --limit.

Support filters:

--user <username>

--status <active|disconnected|terminated>

--since <timestamp> or --days <x>



c. Connect/Disconnect Session

connect: Change status to "active", log timestamp.

disconnect: Change status to "disconnected", preserve state.


d. Terminate Old Sessions

Delete sessions older than x days or update status to "terminated".


e. Logging

Append all actions to a log file (session.log) with timestamps.


f. Auto-Migration (Special Feature)

Monitor VM session load.

If VM is overloaded (e.g., > threshold sessions), reassign/distribute sessions to less-loaded VMs.



---

3. Technologies Used

Python 3: For CLI logic and process simulation.

SQLite: Default persistent store; can plug in Redis or PostgreSQL.

Click or argparse: For CLI parsing.

Multiprocessing or subprocess: To simulate session processes.



---

4. Sample Command-Line Interface

sessman create --user alice
sessman list --page 1 --limit 10 --status active
sessman connect --session-id <id>
sessman disconnect --session-id <id>
sessman terminate --older-than 30
sessman migrate --auto


---

5. Database Schema (SQLite Example)

vms Table

(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, session_count INTEGER)

sessions Table

(id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, user TEXT, vm_id INTEGER, status TEXT,
 created_at TIMESTAMP, updated_at TIMESTAMP)

logs Table

(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, session_id TEXT, event TEXT, timestamp TIMESTAMP)


---

6. Performance Considerations

Index user, status, and timestamp in SQLite for fast filtering.

Use a thread or background job for VM load balancing.

Batched DB operations for bulk listing/termination.

Optional: Switch to Redis or PostgreSQL for high concurrency needs.

7. Bonus: Auto-Migration Pseudocode

def auto_migrate(threshold=100):
    overloaded = get_vms_with_sessions_above(threshold)
    underloaded = get_vms_with_sessions_below(threshold // 2)
    for vm in overloaded:
        sessions_to_move = get_sessions(vm, limit=5)
        for session in sessions_to_move:
            target_vm = underloaded.pop(0)
            move_session(session, target_vm)
            underloaded.append(target_vm)
