rTo make your log files persistent even after deploying a new version of your Flask app via Jenkins and Docker, you need to store logs outside the Docker containerâ€”otherwise, they'll be overwritten every time the container is rebuilt or restarted.

Here's how to do it:


---

âœ… Solution: Use Docker Volume for Log Persistence

1. Create a Volume Mount for the Logs

Mount a directory from the host system into the container so logs live on the host.

In your docker run command (or docker-compose.yml, or Jenkins pipeline), add:

-v /var/logs/my_flask_app:/app/log

This binds the host path /var/logs/my_flask_app to the container path /app/log.

2. Update Your Flask App to Write Logs to /app/log

Your current LOG_DIR = 'log' is fine as long as that resolves to /app/log inside the container.

Your LOG_FILES definition is already correct because it uses os.path.join(LOG_DIR, ...).

3. Ensure Log Directory Exists

Before writing logs, ensure the log directory exists in the container (which will now be the mounted volume):

import os

LOG_DIR = 'log'
os.makedirs(LOG_DIR, exist_ok=True)  # Add this before any logging happens

4. Ensure Permissions Are Set Properly

Make sure that the container user has write permissions on /var/logs/my_flask_app on the host.

You might need to do:

sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /var/logs/my_flask_app

Replace 1000:1000 with the UID/GID used by your Docker container if needed.

ðŸ§ª Example Jenkinsfile (Snippet)

pipeline {
  agent {
    docker {
      image 'your-image-name'
      args '-v /var/logs/my_flask_app:/app/log'
    }
  }
  stages {
    stage('Deploy') {
      steps {
        sh 'docker run -d -v /var/logs/my_flask_app:/app/log your-image-name'
      }
    }
  }
}

âœ… Summary

Task	Implementation

Log persistence	Use Docker volume mount
Log path in Flask	Keep using 'log' (mapped to /app/log)
Avoid log wipe on deploy	Logs stored on host, not overwritten with container
Ensure dir exists	os.makedirs(LOG_DIR, exist_ok=True)
Permissions	chown on host folder if needed


Would you like help modifying your Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml to reflect this setup?
