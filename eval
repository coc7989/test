Got it üëç I‚Äôll break down your senior‚Äôs instructions into concrete steps so you know what to do.


---

What your senior is suggesting

The idea is:

Take an existing benchmark test setup (48epyc_9274F) as a template.

Copy it for the new Lenovo eval server.

Adjust the configs so jobs run under different core allocations.

Submit jobs that ‚Äúfill up‚Äù the machine in different ways (1 core per job, multi-core per job, etc.).

Measure runtimes and compare them to the baseline (48epyc_9274F).



---

Step-by-step interpretation

1. Go to the benchmark directory

cd /data/dvreport/dev/benchmark/spectreX/tc


2. Find the template benchmark setup

There should be a directory or config named 48epyc_9274F (that‚Äôs probably the profile for an AMD EPYC 9274F system).



3. Copy it for the new server

Say your new Lenovo server is lenovo_eval (replace with real name).


cp -r 48epyc_9274F lenovo_eval


4. Update job config files inside the new copy

Open the scripts/config files in lenovo_eval/.

Adjust the host name (so jobs actually run on the new server).

Update core counts: if your new server has, for example, 48 cores, you need test cases like:

48 jobs √ó 1 core each

6 jobs √ó 8 cores each

Maybe 12 jobs √ó 4 cores each

Essentially different ways of ‚Äúpacking‚Äù the cores until the whole server is full.



‚ö° This simulates different workload patterns.


5. Submit jobs to LSF

Likely something like:

bsub < jobscript.sh

The scripts in that directory should already have example submission commands.



6. Collect timing results

After jobs finish, check LSF output logs (lsf.o* files or similar).

Note runtimes for each job configuration.



7. Compare with baseline

Look at the runtime results from the existing 48epyc_9274F runs.

See if the Lenovo eval server is faster/slower for different job patterns.





---

‚úÖ So in summary:
You are cloning an existing benchmark config ‚Üí adapting it to your new server (hostname + core layout) ‚Üí running jobs in different ‚Äúpacking‚Äù modes ‚Üí measuring and comparing runtimes.


---

Do you want me to draft an exact example of how the job config (say for 48 cores) would look so you can copy-paste and test, or do you prefer just the high-level guidance?




hhPerfect üëç Let‚Äôs make a concrete example.
I‚Äôll assume your Lenovo eval server has 48 cores (adjust numbers if it‚Äôs different).


---

Example job configs

In your copied folder (e.g. lenovo_eval/), you‚Äôll likely have job scripts like job_1core.sh, job_8core.sh, etc. If not, you can create them.

1. Single-core test (48 √ó 1 core jobs)

job_1core.sh

#!/bin/bash
#BSUB -J bench_1c[1-48]       # array job with 48 tasks
#BSUB -n 1                    # 1 core per task
#BSUB -R "span[hosts=1]"      # keep each job on one host
#BSUB -oo logs/bench_1c.%J.%I.out
#BSUB -eo logs/bench_1c.%J.%I.err

# Run your benchmark workload
/path/to/benchmark --cores 1

This will submit 48 single-core jobs, filling the host.


---

2. 8-core test (6 √ó 8 core jobs)

job_8core.sh

#!/bin/bash
#BSUB -J bench_8c[1-6]        # array job with 6 tasks
#BSUB -n 8                    # each job uses 8 cores
#BSUB -R "span[ptile=8]"      # pack 8 cores per job on the host
#BSUB -oo logs/bench_8c.%J.%I.out
#BSUB -eo logs/bench_8c.%J.%I.err

/path/to/benchmark --cores 8


---

3. 4-core test (12 √ó 4 core jobs)

job_4core.sh

#!/bin/bash
#BSUB -J bench_4c[1-12]
#BSUB -n 4
#BSUB -R "span[ptile=4]"
#BSUB -oo logs/bench_4c.%J.%I.out
#BSUB -eo logs/bench_4c.%J.%I.err

/path/to/benchmark --cores 4


---

4. Full-host test (1 √ó 48 core job)

job_48core.sh

#!/bin/bash
#BSUB -J bench_48c
#BSUB -n 48
#BSUB -R "span[hosts=1]"
#BSUB -oo logs/bench_48c.%J.out
#BSUB -eo logs/bench_48c.%J.err

/path/to/benchmark --cores 48


---

Running them

From inside lenovo_eval/:

mkdir -p logs
bsub < job_1core.sh
bsub < job_4core.sh
bsub < job_8core.sh
bsub < job_48core.sh


---

Collecting results

After jobs complete, look in logs/.
Each .out file will contain the runtime of your workload.
You‚Äôll compare these numbers to the ones in the baseline (48epyc_9274F) to see how the Lenovo server performs.


---

üëâ Do you want me to also show you how to automatically extract and summarize runtimes from the LSF output logs so you don‚Äôt have to check them one by one?



hPerfect üöÄ since the Lenovo eval server has 128 cores, we‚Äôll set up the new benchmark copy accordingly.


---

Step 1: Copy the template

From the benchmark directory:

cd /data/dvreport/dev/benchmark/spectreX/tc
cp -r 48epyc_9274F lenovo_128c

Now you‚Äôll have a fresh benchmark setup at:

/data/dvreport/dev/benchmark/spectreX/tc/lenovo_128c


---

Step 2: Decide job packing strategies

You want to fill all 128 cores with different job shapes. Examples:

1 core √ó 128 jobs

2 cores √ó 64 jobs

4 cores √ó 32 jobs

8 cores √ó 16 jobs

16 cores √ó 8 jobs

32 cores √ó 4 jobs

64 cores √ó 2 jobs

128 cores √ó 1 job


That way you cover single-threaded scaling, medium parallelism, and full-host workloads.


---

Step 3: Adjust job scripts

Inside lenovo_128c/, create or edit job submission scripts.
For example:

1 core √ó 128 jobs

#!/bin/bash
#BSUB -J bench_1c[1-128]
#BSUB -n 1
#BSUB -R "span[hosts=1]"
#BSUB -oo logs/bench_1c.%J.%I.out
#BSUB -eo logs/bench_1c.%J.%I.err

/path/to/benchmark --cores 1

8 cores √ó 16 jobs

#!/bin/bash
#BSUB -J bench_8c[1-16]
#BSUB -n 8
#BSUB -R "span[ptile=8]"
#BSUB -oo logs/bench_8c.%J.%I.out
#BSUB -eo logs/bench_8c.%J.%I.err

/path/to/benchmark --cores 8

128 cores √ó 1 job

#!/bin/bash
#BSUB -J bench_128c
#BSUB -n 128
#BSUB -R "span[hosts=1]"
#BSUB -oo logs/bench_128c.%J.out
#BSUB -eo logs/bench_128c.%J.err

/path/to/benchmark --cores 128

(Repeat for 2c/4c/16c/32c/64c as needed.)


---

Step 4: Submit jobs

From inside lenovo_128c/:

mkdir -p logs
bsub < job_1core.sh
bsub < job_2core.sh
bsub < job_4core.sh
bsub < job_8core.sh
bsub < job_16core.sh
bsub < job_32core.sh
bsub < job_64core.sh
bsub < job_128core.sh


---

Step 5: Compare results

When jobs finish, check logs/*.out for runtimes.
Compare them against the existing baseline (48epyc_9274F) to see how the Lenovo 128-core box scales.


---

‚ö° Question for you: do you want me to also give you a script that automatically generates all these job submission scripts (1c/2c/4c‚Ä¶/128c) instead of writing them by hand?
