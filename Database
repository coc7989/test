yHere's a more structured, polished version of your Individual Development Plan (IDP) that aligns with your manager’s request. It breaks your objectives into clear categories like goals, projects, certifications, and innovation areas, with professional and actionable language:


---

Individual Development Plan (IDP) – [Your Name]

Goal for the Year:
Enhance my technical and leadership capabilities by driving key infrastructure projects, achieving certification goals, and contributing innovative solutions in the compute space (LSF, Slurm). Focus will be on improving system performance, scalability, and reliability.


---

1. Project Deliverables

Complete myLSF Phase 2:
Successfully deliver enhancements and stability improvements in the myLSF Phase 2 release, ensuring improved user experience and functionality.

Lead FLAMESHub Phase 2:
Take end-to-end ownership of FLAMESHub Phase 2 development, ensuring timely delivery with improved performance and scalability features.

Design Complexity Project:
Drive the design complexity initiative to explore architectural improvements and uncover optimization opportunities across compute workloads.



---

2. Technical Upskilling and Certification

RHCSA Certification:
Complete Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA) training and certification to strengthen foundational Linux and system administration skills.



---

3. Innovation and Infrastructure Improvements

Innovation in Compute Infrastructure:

Design and implement innovative compute solutions using Ansible and Kubernetes, particularly in LSF and Slurm environments.

Create real-world job simulation environments by:

Increasing CPU slots on test servers to emulate a scaled setup (e.g., 10 execution hosts with 8 slots each).

Setting up multiple Docker-based execution hosts on a single server.



Observability Enhancements:

Improve monitoring and observability in compute environments using Zabbix for both LSF and Slurm platforms.


Infrastructure as Code (IaC):

Implement solutions to auto-scale execution hosts during peak hours using IaC principles.

Automate queue management by dynamically adjusting slot availability based on usage patterns (e.g., increase for busy queues, decrease for infrequently used ones).


Resiliency and Fault Tolerance:

Design auto-resubmission mechanisms for failed LSF jobs due to node issues, software errors, or resource limits.

Investigate checkpointing or job migration strategies to avoid wasted compute time from failed long-running jobs.




---

4. DevOps and CI/CD Improvements

Docker and Bitbucket Integration:

Develop a Jenkins pipeline to build and push Docker images to Bitbucket, and sync images across all regions. Alternatively, explore compressed image delivery for efficiency.

Evaluate use of Docker Hub private repositories for better control and access.




---

5. User Migration and Platform Upgrade

WS70 to WS80 Migration:

Lead or contribute to the migration of users from WS70 to WS80, ensuring minimal disruption and enhanced performance in the upgraded environment.
