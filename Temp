Subject: New Application Deployment Handbook Now Available

Hi Team,

I hope you're doing well.

I’m excited to inform you that I’ve completed the Application Deployment Handbook, which is now available for everyone to use. This handbook will serve as a comprehensive guide for all our deployment-related processes. It covers the full setup, from folder structure and environment variables to the Docker and Jenkins pipeline configuration, including integration with Bitbucket for CI/CD.

What's in the Handbook?

Folder Structure: A clear breakdown of how to organize project files and maintain a clean, manageable structure.

Jenkins & Docker Pipeline: Step-by-step instructions on setting up Jenkins pipelines for both frontend and backend applications using Docker.

Bitbucket Integration: Guidelines on using Bitbucket repositories and branches for seamless deployment to different environments (e.g., dev, prod).

Best Practices: Recommendations on environment variables, security credentials, and debugging tips to make the deployment process smoother.


How to Utilize It?

For New Deployments: Follow the instructions outlined to set up new projects, ensure proper folder structure, and configure Jenkins pipelines correctly.

For Troubleshooting: Use the handbook to understand the deployment process and troubleshoot issues with environments, container configurations, or build failures.

For Continuous Integration: Learn how the handbook leverages Bitbucket and Jenkins to automate deployments, reducing manual intervention and errors.


The handbook can be found on our Confluence page [Insert Link]. Please feel free to go through it, and if you have any questions or suggestions for improvement, don’t hesitate to reach out.

Thanks, and I hope this document proves helpful for all future deployments!

Best Regards,
[Your Name]
Site Reliability Engineer
