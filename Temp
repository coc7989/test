Hi Team,

I hope you're doing well.

I’m excited to inform you that I’ve completed the Application Deployment Handbook, which is now available for everyone to use. This handbook serves as a comprehensive guide for all our deployment-related processes. It covers everything from setting up folder structure and environment variables to configuring the Docker and Jenkins pipeline for seamless application deployment.

What's in the Handbook?

Folder Structure: Clear guidelines on organizing your project files for better maintainability and structure.

Jenkins & Docker Pipeline: Detailed steps on setting up the Jenkins pipeline for our application deployments, including Docker configuration to automate the build and run process.

Master Branch Setup: Guidelines for utilizing the master branch to deploy the latest changes efficiently, ensuring a smooth CI/CD workflow.

Best Practices: Recommendations on handling environment variables, managing security credentials, and tips for debugging during deployment.


How to Utilize It?

For New Deployments: Follow the provided instructions to set up and maintain a clean project structure and automate the deployment process using Jenkins and Docker.

For Troubleshooting: Reference the handbook for troubleshooting tips when dealing with deployment issues or build failures.

For Continuous Integration: Learn how to effectively use the master branch for your deployments, minimizing manual intervention and reducing errors.


The handbook is now available on our Confluence page [Insert Link]. Feel free to review it, and let me know if you have any questions or feedback for improvement.

Thanks, and I hope this resource proves helpful in streamlining our deployment process!

Best Regards,
