To install `httpd` (Apache HTTP Server) on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) system using SaltStack (Salt Master and Minion setup), you need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Ensure Salt Master and Minion are Set Up
1. Make sure the Salt Master and Minion are installed and running.
2. The Minion should be configured to connect to the Master.

### Step 2: Create a Salt State File
Create a Salt state file to manage the `httpd` package installation. 

1. On the Salt Master, create a directory for your state files, if it doesn't exist:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /srv/salt
   ```

2. Create a new state file named `install_httpd.sls` inside the `/srv/salt` directory:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /srv/salt/install_httpd.sls
   ```

3. Add the following content to the `install_httpd.sls` file:
   ```yaml
   install_httpd:
     pkg.installed:
       - name: httpd
   ```

   This state file tells the Minion to install the `httpd` package.

### Step 3: Apply the State File
1. On the Salt Master, run the following command to apply the state file to the desired Minion(s):
   ```bash
   sudo salt '<minion-id>' state.apply install_httpd
   ```
   Replace `<minion-id>` with the ID of the Minion where you want to install `httpd`. If you want to apply it to all Minions, you can use `'*'` instead of `<minion-id>`.

### Step 4: Verify Installation
1. On the Minion, verify that `httpd` is installed by running:
   ```bash
   rpm -q httpd
   ```
   Or, check the status of the `httpd` service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status httpd
   ```

### Step 5: Start and Enable the httpd Service (Optional)
If you want to start and enable the `httpd` service automatically after installation, update the `install_httpd.sls` file to include:
```yaml
install_httpd:
  pkg.installed:
    - name: httpd

start_httpd:
  service.running:
    - name: httpd
    - enable: True
    - require:
      - pkg: install_httpd
```

Now, apply the state file again using the same `salt` command:
```bash
sudo salt '<minion-id>' state.apply install_httpd
```

This will install the `httpd` package, start the service, and enable it to start on boot.
