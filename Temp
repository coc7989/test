The code you've written generally follows good practices, but there are several improvements that can be made for clarity, efficiency, and maintainability. Here are a few suggestions:

1. SQL Query Handling:

It's always a good idea to handle exceptions when dealing with database operations. You should wrap your database operations in try-except-finally to ensure any errors are caught, and resources are released properly.

Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection (although it seems you're already doing this with :vendor_name, etc.).


def feature_manage(file_path):
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as license_file:
            text = license_file.read()

        # (rest of the function code here)

        cursor = connection.cursor()
        sql_delete = "DELETE FROM EXPIRY WHERE VENDOR_NAME = :vendor_name AND SERVER_NAME = :server_name"
        cursor.execute(sql_delete, {'vendor_name': vendor_name, 'server_name': server_name})

        sql_insert = """
            INSERT INTO EXPIRY (SERVER_NAME, FEATURE_NAME, VENDOR_NAME, VERSION, EXPIRY_DATE, COUNT)
            VALUES (:server_name, :feature_name, :vendor_name, :version, :expiry_date, :count)
        """
        for match in matches:
            cursor.execute(sql_insert, match)

        connection.commit()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error occurred: {e}")
        connection.rollback()
    finally:
        if cursor:
            cursor.close()

2. Error Handling for Missing Files or Invalid Inputs:

If the file does not exist, open() will throw an error. Consider adding error handling for this.

def feature_manage(file_path):
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as license_file:
            text = license_file.read()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: File '{file_path}' not found.")
        return
    except IOError as e:
        print(f"Error reading file '{file_path}': {e}")
        return

3. Avoid Repetitive Code for Expiry Date:

You have this block:

if expiry_date == "permanent" or expiry_date.endswith('0000'):
    expiry_date = '31-dec-9999'

You could clean this up by using a simpler check:

expiry_date = '31-dec-9999' if expiry_date == "permanent" or expiry_date.endswith('0000') else expiry_date

4. Regex Compilation for Reuse:

Instead of recompiling the regex in every iteration, compile the patterns once outside the loop.

pattern_stop = re.compile(r'########################## LICENSE KEYS END HERE ######################')
pattern_feature = re.compile(r'(?:INCREMENT|FEATURE|LICENSE)\s+(\S+)\s+(\S+)\s+(\d+|\d+\.\d+)\s+((?:\d+-[a-zA-Z]{3}-\d+)|permanent)\s+(?:\\?\s*(\d+)|\d+)')
server_pattern = re.compile(r'(?:(?<=\bHOST\b)|(?<=\bSERVER\b))\s+\b[\w.-]+\b(?=\s)')

for line in text.split('\n'):
    if pattern_stop.search(line):
        break

    match_feature = pattern_feature.match(line)
    if match_feature:
        # Process the match

5. Efficiency with Checksum Storage:

You're recalculating checksums for each file. If your checksum store is in a file or database, you might want to minimize file/database I/O. Consider caching or minimizing the calls.

6. Improving Readability:

It's a good idea to break down the logic into smaller helper functions. For instance, extracting feature information can be a separate function.

def extract_feature_info(line, pattern_feature, file_path):
    match_feature = pattern_feature.match(line)
    if match_feature:
        feature_name, vendor_name, version, expiry_date, count = match_feature.groups()
        if file_path == '/home/flames/data/simplis.lelvflames19.lic':
            feature_name, vendor_name = vendor_name, feature_name
        expiry_date = '31-dec-9999' if expiry_date == "permanent" or expiry_date.endswith('0000') else expiry_date
        return feature_name, vendor_name, version, expiry_date, count
    return None

7. Handling Edge Cases:

If a file contains malformed data, the regex match might fail. Ensure you are handling such cases gracefully with proper logging or error messages.

for line in text.split('\n'):
    if pattern_stop.search(line):
        break

    feature_info = extract_feature_info(line, pattern_feature, file_path)
    if feature_info:
        feature_name, vendor_name, version, expiry_date, count = feature_info
        # Proceed to add it to the matches
    else:
        print(f"Warning: Invalid feature line in file {file_path}: {line}")

8. Checksum and File Modification Logic:

Consider moving the checksum logic to a separate class or module if it's reused elsewhere. This will make the code more modular and maintainable.
