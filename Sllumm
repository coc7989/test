That’s a big opportunity 🚀 — with the Slurm REST API you’re not limited to just showing job tables. You can actually build a full-featured cluster monitoring and management dashboard.

Here are the major possibilities, grouped by use case:


---

🔹 1. Job Monitoring & Management

Job list / table (per-user or all jobs) → like you already have.

Job details view → drill down into CPU/memory usage, nodes allocated, stdout/stderr files.

Job submission → form in the dashboard where a user can upload a script and run sbatch via API.

Cancel jobs → add a “Cancel” button (maps to scancel).

Hold/release jobs → via Slurm’s job control endpoints.

Requeue jobs → retry failed jobs.

Job history → completed jobs of a user with states & reasons.



---

🔹 2. Cluster Overview

Cluster health summary → partitions, nodes, up/down status.

Node list → display each node’s state (idle, allocated, drained).

Partition usage → how many jobs per partition, utilization %.

Resource utilization:

CPUs allocated vs total

GPUs allocated vs total

Memory usage per node or partition



This gives admins a quick view like sinfo + scontrol show nodes.


---

🔹 3. User Experience Improvements

Personal dashboard:

“My Active Jobs”

“My Completed Jobs (last 7 days)”

Efficiency metrics: requested vs used resources


Notifications:

Job finished → pop-up or email/webhook

Job failed → highlight in red with reason


Job efficiency heatmap: visualize how well jobs used resources.



---

🔹 4. Admin / Power Features

(if you want this dashboard to help admins too)

Queue backlog view: pending jobs by reason (resources, dependency, priority).

User accounting: who is consuming the most CPU/GPU hours.

Fairshare metrics: show each user’s share vs usage.

Cluster load trends (line charts over time).

Maintenance controls: drain/undrain nodes, set partitions offline.



---

🔹 5. Visualization Ideas

With a charting library (like @mui/x-charts, recharts, or Plotly):

Stacked bar → jobs by state (Running/Pending/Completed).

Pie chart → resource usage by partition.

Heatmap → node allocation (like a rack view).

Line chart → cluster utilization over time.

Leaderboard → top users by GPU hours this week.



---

🔹 6. Advanced Features

Job templates: users can save frequently used sbatch settings.

Interactive job submission: let users request interactive sessions via dashboard.

Logs & output preview: view tail of stdout/stderr without SSH.

Alerts: e.g. notify when cluster utilization > 90%.

Authentication / RBAC: integrate with LDAP/OIDC so users only see their jobs.

Multi-cluster support: if you have multiple Slurm clusters, switch between them.



---

🔹 Example Features Mapping to REST API

/jobs → jobs list, filter, monitor.

/job/{id} → detailed job info.

/nodes → node states (down, drained, allocated).

/partitions → partition configurations.

/submit → submit new jobs (sbatch).

/cancel/{id} → cancel job.

/licenses → software license availability (if tracked by Slurm).

/accounting → historical usage.



---

✅ So, your dashboard could grow from a simple job viewer → into a full HPC web portal with submission, monitoring, efficiency analysis, and even admin tools.
