Slide 3: What is CI/CD?

Continuous Integration (CI):
Automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project.

Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD):
Automating the release of integrated changes to production (Deployment) or a staging environment (Delivery).

Focus: Automating and streamlining the software development lifecycle.



---

Slide 4: Why is CI/CD Important?

Speeds up software delivery.

Reduces manual errors and improves accuracy.

Encourages collaboration among teams.

Enables quick detection and resolution of bugs.

Improves customer satisfaction through faster updates.



---

Slide 5: Key Components of CI/CD

1. Version Control System (VCS): Tracks changes in code (e.g., Git).


2. Build Automation: Compiling and packaging code.


3. Automated Testing: Ensures code quality through unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.


4. Continuous Integration: Merging and validating changes frequently.


5. Continuous Deployment/Delivery: Pushing changes to production or staging environments.




---

Slide 6: CI/CD Workflow

1. Code Commit: Developers commit code to a VCS (e.g., Git).


2. Build: Automated build process triggers.


3. Test: Automated tests validate the build.


4. Deploy: Approved builds are deployed to staging or production.


5. Feedback: Monitoring and feedback guide iterations.
(Visualize with a flowchart on the slide.)

Slide 7: Tools for CI/CD

CI Tools: Jenkins, CircleCI, TravisCI, GitLab CI/CD.

Version Control: Git, GitHub, GitLab.

Build Tools: Maven, Gradle, npm.

Testing Tools: Selenium, JUnit, TestNG.

Deployment Tools: Kubernetes, Docker, AWS CodeDeploy.



---

Slide 8: Benefits of CI/CD

Faster time-to-market.

Higher code quality and reliability.

Improved team collaboration.

Early bug detection and resolution.

Continuous feedback loop.



---

Slide 9: Challenges of CI/CD

Initial setup and learning curve.

Integration with legacy systems.

Dependency management.

Scaling infrastructure for large teams.

Maintaining test coverage and quality.



---

Slide 10: Best Practices for CI/CD

Commit small and frequent changes.

Automate everything (builds, tests, deployments).

Use feature flags for incremental rollouts.

Monitor system performance post-deployment.

Regularly update and maintain CI/CD pipelines.



---

Slide 11: Case Study/Example (Optional)

Briefly describe a real-world example where CI/CD improved software delivery.



---

Slide 12: Q&A

Invite questions and discussion.

Provide contact details for follow-up.
