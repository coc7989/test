Revolutionizing License Management with Automation

Prior Art Challenges:
Traditional license management was a manual, time-intensive process involving the ITSM platform, where users logged requests for license merges or replacements. Flames L2 admins manually manipulated license files, referencing vendor-specific articles and engaging in feedback loops that spanned 2-3 days. The process was error-prone, lacked transparency, and did not include proactive features or rollback mechanisms, making it unsuitable for scalable and efficient operations.

Limitations of Prior Methods:
The manual nature of the process resulted in significant time delays, with each request taking an average of 20 minutes of manual effort, further prolonged by discrepancies and human errors. Users had minimal visibility into request progress, leading to dependency on admin communication, and there were no mechanisms for automated error handling or rollback, exposing the system to potential instability. Additionally, the system struggled to scale as license demands increased, compounding inefficiencies.

How This Work is Better:
The new solution offers end-to-end automation and scalability by introducing a self-service portal that eliminates the need for admin intervention. Users can log in to initiate requests, upload license files, and view real-time status. Backend processing using Flask automates file manipulation, while Jenkins pipelines validate changes, compare old and new files for user confirmation, and handle synchronization with the production server. In the event of a failure, an automatic rollback mechanism ensures system stability. The solution also incorporates proactive alerts for critical or expiring licenses, a Master List dashboard for centralized tracking, and visual tools for actionable insights. By reducing turnaround time from days to minutes, eliminating manual errors, and providing real-time transparency, this approach not only addresses prior inefficiencies but also introduces a robust, scalable framework for modern license management.
