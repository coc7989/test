Proposed Solution

Overview

Developed a Self-Service License Management Portal to automate the traditionally manual and error-prone process of license file installation, updates, and validation.

The portal eliminates inefficiencies by automating file manipulation, comparison, and deployment, reducing the cycle time from 2-3 days to under a few minutes.

Solution Architecture

Refer to the architecture diagram for visualization.

1. Frontend Portal:

Built with a user-friendly interface to enable WPL users to log requests, upload license files, and view submission history.

Provides features such as proactive alerts for critical/expiring licenses, access to license details, and insightful visualizations.



2. Backend Automation:

Flask-based Backend:

Handles requests and automates license file processing.

Logs all activity in a centralized Oracle database.


Jenkins Pipelines:

Automatically triggers comparison and validation workflows.

Performs synchronization and post-validation of updated license files on the application server.




3. Database:

Oracle DB stores:

User submission history.

License comparison logs.

Expiring license reminders.




4. Error-Handling Mechanism:

Automated rollback to the previous valid license file ensures stability in case of failures.

Workflow Implementation

Step-by-Step Process:

1. Request Submission:

User logs a request specifying the vendor and operation.

New license files are uploaded via the portal.



2. License File Processing:

Backend Flask app manipulates old and new license files to generate the updated file.



3. Comparison and Validation:

A Jenkins pipeline compares the updated file with the original, with results displayed in the portal for user confirmation.



4. Deployment:

On user approval, the updated file is synchronized to the production server.



5. Post-Validation:

Jenkins performs validation checks. If an issue arises, an automatic rollback is triggered.

Key Features of the Portal

Automation:

Fully automates license generation, validation, and deployment workflows.


Proactive Notifications:

Alerts users about expiring features or licenses.


Central Repository:

A master dashboard provides a consolidated view of licenses.


Enhanced Accuracy:

Eliminates manual errors through automated file comparison and validation.


Scalability:

Designed to handle multiple vendors and operations seamlessly.

Results

Time Efficiency:

Reduced processing time from 20 minutes per file + delays to minutes for the entire workflow.


Error Reduction:

Manual errors due to misfiled data or mismatches are eliminated.


Transparency:

Users can track their requests and approvals in real-time.


Reliability:

Automated rollback ensures the system remains stable even in failure scenarios.
