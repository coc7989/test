License installation was a manual, time-intensive process, requiring WPL users to log requests through ITSM. Flames L2 admins would retrieve tickets, consult vendor-specific guidelines, and spend ~20 minutes manually updating license files. This process often involved 2â€“3 days of back-and-forth emails to address errors, causing inefficiencies.

To solve these challenges, a self-service portal now automates the workflow. Users log in, choose the vendor and server, specify operations, and upload license files. Flask-based backend processing manipulates the files, while a Jenkins pipeline compares updates with originals, displaying differences for user confirmation. Approved updates are synchronized to production, with post-validation checks ensuring accuracy. Failures trigger automated rollbacks to the last working file, maintaining system stability.

The portal offers submission history for users, request tracking for admins, and proactive alerts for critical or expiring licenses. It also includes a Master List dashboard, feature search, and charts for insightful visualizations. This automation significantly reduces manual effort, accelerates installation, and enhances transparency, providing a scalable solution for efficient license management.
