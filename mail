Subject: Migration to NPDE Jenkins Instance

Dear Team,

I hope this email finds you well.

For those who may not be aware, NPDE has its own dedicated Jenkins instance: jenkins-tde-cloud.dal.design.com. Moving forward, please ensure you utilize this instance for all your Jenkins-related project dependencies.

If you currently have any jobs under the jenkins-pci.dal.design.com instance, kindly prioritize migrating them to the NPDE Jenkins instance.

For any questions or if you require assistance or access specific to your project needs, please feel free to reach out to me or Chandan.

Thank you for your cooperation in streamlining our processes.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
