üóÉÔ∏è SQL Interview Questions & Answers

Question	Answer

1. What is SQL?	SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to manage and query relational databases.
2. What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING?	WHERE filters rows before grouping; HAVING filters groups after aggregation.
3. What does SELECT DISTINCT do?	Returns only unique (non-duplicate) values from a column or set of columns.
4. What is a JOIN?	Combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column.
5. What is the difference between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN?	INNER JOIN: returns matching rows only; LEFT JOIN: all rows from the left table, matched or not.
6. What is a primary key?	A unique identifier for each row in a table; cannot be null.
7. What is a foreign key?	A field that refers to the primary key of another table to enforce referential integrity.
8. How do you get the second highest salary from a table?	Example: SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);
9. What is the difference between DELETE, TRUNCATE, and DROP?	DELETE: removes rows (can be rolled back), TRUNCATE: removes all rows (faster, no rollback), DROP: deletes table structure.
10. What is a subquery?	A query nested inside another SQL query.
11. What is an index?	A performance-boosting structure that speeds up data retrieval.
12. What is normalization?	Process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve integrity.
13. What is a view?	A virtual table based on a SQL query, doesn't store data itself.
14. What is the difference between COUNT(*), COUNT(column), and COUNT(DISTINCT column)?	COUNT(*): all rows, COUNT(column): non-null values, COUNT(DISTINCT column): unique non-null values.
15. What does GROUP BY do?	Groups rows sharing a value so aggregate functions (e.g. SUM, COUNT) can be applied to each group.
16. What is the use of ORDER BY?	Sorts the result set in ascending or descending order.
17. What is a composite key?	A primary key made up of two or more columns.
18. How can you prevent SQL injection?	Use parameterized queries or prepared statements. Never concatenate raw user input.
19. What are aggregate functions in SQL?	Functions like SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN, and COUNT that operate on sets of rows.
20. How do you update data in SQL?	UPDATE table_name SET column = value WHERE condition;
