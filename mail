Revolutionizing License Management with Automation

Prior Art Challenges:

Traditional processes relied on manual license manipulation, requiring an average of 20 minutes per request.

The workflow involved ITSM-based ticketing, vendor-specific article consultations, and feedback loops lasting 2-3 days.

Lacked proactive features, error mitigation, and rollback mechanisms, making the process time-consuming, error-prone, and non-scalable.


Limitations of Prior Methods:

Time-Intensive: Manual handling slowed down the process significantly.

Error-Prone: Human errors during file editing and validations caused delays.

Lack of Transparency: Users had minimal visibility into the status of their requests.

No Scalability: Increasing license requests overwhelmed the manual system.

System Stability Risks: Failures during license updates had no rollback option.


How This Work is Better:

End-to-End Automation:

A self-service portal allows users to initiate and track requests without admin intervention.

Flask backend processing automates file manipulation, eliminating manual efforts.

Jenkins pipelines handle validation, synchronization, and automatic rollbacks for failures.


Efficiency Gains:

Turnaround time reduced from days to minutes.

Eliminated manual errors through automated file comparisons and validations.

Frees admins for higher-value tasks.


Proactive and Scalable Features:

Alerts for critical/expiring licenses prevent disruptions.

Master List dashboard and visualizations provide centralized tracking and actionable insights.


Improved Transparency: Users can view request history, track status, and confirm updates in real time.

Error Handling and Stability: Automatic rollback ensures system stability and prevents prolonged downtimes.



By combining automation, transparency, and scalability, this solution eliminates inefficiencies of prior methods, ensures accuracy and reliability, and provides a robust framework for modern license management.
