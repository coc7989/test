Subject: Proposal to Use Jenkins Direct Connection with On-Demand Setup

Dear Team,

After reviewing our Jenkins setup, I propose using a direct connection to the master server (dbdmaster.com) with the on-demand option, instead of adding a hop host. When we used a live direct connection, it maintained minimal overhead to keep the connection alive, utilizing 0.1% to 0.7% CPU and 0.1% memory. However, by switching to the on-demand option, this constant load is eliminated as the agent only connects during active builds. Performance metrics show CPU usage ranges from 0.0% to ~30%, depending on process complexity, and memory usage ranges from 0.0% to 0.1%, making this setup efficient and resource-conscious.

Using a hop host would not reduce the load on dbdmaster.com during builds, as tasks still execute there. It would add unnecessary complexity without any real performance gains. The on-demand setup achieves the same objective—minimizing load during idle times—while keeping the architecture simple and reliable. I recommend continuing with the direct connection using the on-demand configuration. Please share your thoughts.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
