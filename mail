Got it! Here's the revised version with unchanged questions but rephrased answers:


---

1. What version control tool do we use to manage LSF configuration files?
-> We utilize the RCS tool for managing these configuration files.


2. What are the files updated in /data/lsf/conf and /data/lsf/conf/lsbatch/tii-shared/configdir/groups?
-> In the /data/lsf/conf/lsbatch/tii-shared/configdir/groups directory, the linux_mthread_srv_nodes file is updated, while in /data/lsf/conf, the lsf.cluster.tii-shared file is modified.


3. What do we mean when we say exclusive resource for a particular host?
-> It refers to hosts that are designated to execute jobs specifically requiring the "exclusive" resource, as defined in the jobâ€™s resource selection criteria.


4. What Unix account should you use to check in/out files?
-> You should use your personal Unix account instead of privileged accounts like root or lsfadmin.


5. Can you provide the Unix commands you would use to check out a file for step 2?
-> The command is: co -l lsf.cluster.tii-shared.


6. What is the command to look up revision logs of these files?
-> To view revision logs, you can use: rlog file_name.


7. What is the command to see the updates of the files you edited versus previous committed version?
-> Use the command rcsdiff file_name to compare your changes with the previously committed version.


8. What did we change on these 2 files to move this host lincasj01 from sawshark to mthread?

The host was removed from the linux_768G40C_batch_nodes file.

In the lsf.cluster.tii-shared file, the line:
ws80 !sawshark mthread
was updated to:
ws80 !mthread.



9. What hosts do you need to login to reconfigure LSF?
-> You need to log in to the LSF master servers, which are currently master05.com and master06.com.



Bonus Question

1. What commands do we use to reconfigure LSF after the config file updates?

First, validate the configuration with:
/data/sudo/bin/sudo -E -u lsfadmin badmin ckconfig.

If no errors are detected, apply the configuration using:
/data/sudo/bin/sudo -E -u lsfadmin badmin reconfig.
