üîß 1. LSF Job Scheduler Health and Performance
Critical Areas:

Job throughput and queue delays


Scheduler daemon health (mbatchd, sbatchd)


License usage (if any licensed features like Intel compilers, ANSYS, etc.)


Key Metrics:

Number of pending jobs (bjobs -p)


Average job wait time


mbatchd daemon status & restart count


sbatchd status per compute node


Queue lengths and utilization


Job failure rates


License usage (via lmstat or FlexLM integration)


üñ•Ô∏è 2. Compute Node Health & UtilizationCritical Areas:

Node availability and responsiveness


Resource bottlenecks (CPU, memory, disk)


Thermal or hardware issues (especially in HPCI systems)


Key Metrics:

CPU load average per node


Memory usage (used vs. available)


Disk usage / inode exhaustion


GPU utilization (if applicable)


Network throughput and latency


Node down/unreachable events


Hardware errors (via IPMI, sensors, or logs)


üì¶ 3. Cluster Resource UtilizationCritical Areas:

Underutilized or overloaded resources


Imbalanced workload distribution


Key Metrics:
Core hours used vs. available


Memory usage trends across the cluster


Job slot usage per node or group



Idle vs. active node time



Resource reservation patterns


üßë‚Äçüî¨ 4. User Behavior and Job EfficiencyCritical Areas:

Inefficient job scripts or resource requests


Misuse of shared resources



Frequent job failures or reruns


Key Metrics:
Top N users by job submissions



Top users by CPU/memory consumption


Jobs exceeding walltime or memory limits


Job exit codes and failure reasons


Ratio of successful vs. failed jobs

üîç Expanded Monitoring Dimensions
1. LSF Scheduling Efficiency & Job Trends

Backlog analysis: Identify queues/jobs that are perpetually backlogged or starved of resources.


Slot fragmentation: Detect when jobs can't start due to mismatch between requested resources and available slots.


Job array behavior: Monitor massive job arrays for anomalies (e.g., high failure rates, uneven durations).


Job preemption or suspension tracking: Useful if you implement preemptive scheduling policies.


2. Node Lifecycle and Maintenance Awareness

Track nodes entering/exiting maintenance states (bhosts, lsload).


Detect nodes frequently flipping between available and unavailable states‚Äîpossible hardware issues.


Rolling node performance degradation: Over time, disk IO or memory performance can degrade unnoticed.


3. I/O and Filesystem Bottlenecks
Monitor Lustre, GPFS, or NFS performance if using shared filesystems.


Look for slow I/O that delays job completion (especially critical for simulation workloads).


File count & inode usage per user/job temp area.


4. Environmental Metrics (if available)

Temperature, fan speed, power usage per node (through IPMI/SNMP).


High temperature could indicate impending thermal throttling or hardware damage.


5. Job Efficiency Metrics
Resource efficiency scoring per job:


CPU efficiency = CPU time / walltime


Memory efficiency = avg memory used / memory requested




Zombie jobs (jobs doing nothing but still running).


Jobs with high page fault or context switch rates.


6. License Bottlenecks (If using license-based software)
Time jobs spent waiting for license tokens.


License denials per vendor (via FlexLM debug logs).


Peak vs. actual usage of licenses.
