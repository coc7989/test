Yes, you can achieve this by using resource allocation limits and user group configurations in IBM LSF. Specifically, you can configure your LSF cluster to restrict the usage of ws70 to specific users, while allowing unrestricted access to ws80 for all users.

Here are the steps to implement this restriction:


---

1. Define the Resource (ws70) in lsf.shared

Ensure the resources ws70 and ws80 are defined in the lsf.shared configuration file. For example:

Begin Resource
RESOURCENAME  TYPE      INTERVAL  INCREASING  DESCRIPTION
ws70          Boolean   ()        ()          Resource ws70
ws80          Boolean   ()        ()          Resource ws80
End Resource

Run lsadmin reconfig after editing the file.


---

2. Set Up a Resource Allocation Limit

Edit the lsf.cluster.<cluster_name> configuration file to define an allocation limit for the resource ws70 by user group.

Example Configuration:

Begin ResourceMap
RESOURCENAME  HOSTS
ws70          all
ws80          all
End ResourceMap

Begin UserGroup
GROUP_NAME    GROUP_MEMBER
allow_ws70    user1 user2
End UserGroup

Begin ResourceLimit
NAME          USERS         RESOURCES         HOSTS         QUEUES         DURATION
limit_ws70    all           ws70              all           all            0
allow_ws70    @allow_ws70   ws70              all           all            0
End ResourceLimit

The first rule (limit_ws70) blocks all users from using ws70.

The second rule (allow_ws70) allows only users in the allow_ws70 group to use ws70.

3. Reload the Configuration

Run the following commands to apply the new configuration:

lsadmin reconfig
badmin reconfig


---

4. Testing the Configuration

Users not in the allow_ws70 group will receive an error if they try to use ws70:

bsub -R "select[ws70]" my_job

Error: Job not submitted: User does not have permission to use resource ws70.

Users in the allow_ws70 group can submit jobs with ws70:

bsub -R "select[ws70]" my_job

Job is successfully submitted.

Notes

If you need finer control, you can further restrict based on queues or specific hosts by modifying the ResourceLimit section.

Always back up your configuration files before making changes.

Use bresources to verify resource configurations and badmin showlim to check active limits.
