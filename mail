Prior Art

Prior to this solution, license installation was heavily reliant on manual processes. The workflow involved:

1. ITSM-based Ticketing System: Users would log a request for license merge or replacement, initiating a manual intervention process.


2. Manual License Manipulation: Flames L2 admins handled ticket resolutions, consulting vendor-specific articles to merge or replace licenses manually.


3. Extended Feedback Loops: Communication between admins and users spanned 2-3 days on average, with errors or discrepancies often delaying resolution further.


4. No Proactive Features: The existing setup lacked features for proactive alerts or centralized license tracking.



This approach was labor-intensive, error-prone, and inefficient, significantly hindering productivity and user satisfaction.

Limitations of Prior Art

1. Time-Consuming: Manual manipulation of license files consumed an average of 20 minutes per request.


2. Error-Prone: Human errors during file editing and validation often led to discrepancies, requiring additional time for corrections.


3. Lack of Transparency: Users had minimal visibility into request status, leading to frequent inquiries and dependency on admin responses.


4. No Automation or Rollback: The absence of automated validation or rollback mechanisms increased the risk of system instability during failures.


5. Scalability Issues: As license demands increased, the manual process became a bottleneck, failing to scale efficiently.

How is This Work Different and / or Better?

1. End-to-End Automation: The solution automates the entire license management workflow:

Self-Service Portal: Users initiate and monitor requests without admin intervention.

Backend Flask Processing: Automates file manipulation, eliminating manual handling.

Jenkins Pipeline Integration: Ensures automated validation, synchronization, and rollback for error handling.



2. Error Mitigation: The use of automated pipelines ensures:

Accurate File Comparisons: Differences between old and new license files are displayed for user confirmation.

Rollback Mechanism: Automatic restoration of the last known good configuration in case of failure.



3. Proactive and Scalable:

Alerts: Proactive notifications for critical or expiring licenses prevent lapses.

Search and Visualization: Features like historical request access, searchable details, and chart visualizations provide users and admins with actionable insights.

Master List Dashboard: Centralized repository for comprehensive license tracking.



4. Efficiency Gains:

Reduced Turnaround Time: The average time to process requests has dropped from days to minutes.

Resource Optimization: Minimal admin involvement allows skilled resources to focus on higher-value tasks.



5. Improved Transparency: Users have real-time visibility into request status, enhancing trust and reducing dependency on admin responses.



This solution addresses inefficiencies, enhances scalability, and ensures robust, error-free operations, making it a superior alternative to traditional methods.
