Perfect ‚Äî thanks for clarifying üôå
So your full idea is about:

1. Predicting job success/failure before execution


2. Detecting failure patterns + searching docs/KBs for fixes


3. Automatically applying fixes (self-healing jobs)



Here‚Äôs a clean, updated hackathon write-up for you:


---

Topic Name

"Self-Healing Job Scheduler: Predict, Prevent, and Auto-Fix Failures in IBM LSF"


---

Problem Statement

In large compute environments using IBM LSF, jobs can run for days or even weeks before failing due to common issues like missing files, wrong resource requests, or misconfiguration. This leads to wasted compute, higher costs, and delays. Often, the same failure patterns reoccur but users and admins still spend time debugging them manually.


---

Current Challenges

Long jobs waste compute cycles and storage when they fail late.

Failures follow known patterns but are not proactively detected.

Troubleshooting is manual ‚Äî users must search documentation or ask support teams.

Jobs need to be resubmitted after adjusting parameters (CPU, memory, paths), which adds delays.

Valuable admin and user time is spent on repetitive fixes.



---

Business Impact / Outcomes

Reduced Compute Waste: Stop jobs early if they‚Äôre predicted to fail.

Improved Productivity: Automated detection and fixes reduce human effort.

Faster Job Recovery: Jobs can be auto-resubmitted with adjusted resources or corrected paths.

Knowledge Reuse: Past issues and fixes are automatically leveraged instead of rediscovered.

Smarter Scheduling: Jobs with low success probability are flagged, deprioritized, or rerouted.

Cost Savings: Less wasted CPU/GPU cycles and quicker resolution saves infra and labor cost.



---

Project Requirements

1. Collect historical job data (parameters, runtime, exit codes, logs).


2. Build ML model to predict job success/failure before scheduling.


3. Implement failure pattern detection and correlation with past runs.


4. Integrate with documentation & knowledge base for automatic suggestions.


5. Create self-healing actions:

Resubmit failed jobs

Adjust memory/CPU automatically

Fix file path issues



6. Provide a dashboard/notification system to show predictions, actions taken, and results.




---

Estimated Effort

Week 1‚Äì2: Requirement gathering, historical job data collection & cleaning.

Week 3‚Äì4: Build predictive ML model for job success/failure.

Week 5‚Äì6: Failure pattern detection + documentation/KB integration.

Week 7‚Äì8: Develop auto-fix and resubmission mechanisms.

Week 9: Build dashboard/alerts and integrate with LSF job workflows.



---

This way, you‚Äôre positioning the project not just as prediction, but a full self-healing system for LSF workloads ‚Äî much stronger for a hackathon pitch.

üëâ Do you want me to also make a 2‚Äì3 sentence ‚Äúelevator pitch‚Äù version of this idea that you can say quickly to judges/mentors during the hackathon?
