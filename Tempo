Got it üëç thanks for clarifying ‚Äî your idea is about scheduling heavy resource jobs (CPU/memory intensive) during off-peak cluster times (night, weekend, holidays), not about electricity tariffs. That makes it more about cluster efficiency & fairness. Here‚Äôs the revised hackathon write-up:

Topic Name

"Smart Scheduling of Heavy Jobs in IBM LSF"


---

Problem Statement

In large compute clusters, heavy jobs that demand many CPUs, GPUs, or large memory often run during peak hours. This blocks cluster capacity for smaller or urgent jobs, causes longer queue times, and reduces overall throughput. Currently, jobs are scheduled based only on queue order, not on system load patterns or workload type.


---

Current Challenges

Heavy jobs consume significant cluster resources and delay smaller jobs.

No automated way to differentiate urgent jobs vs. resource-heavy jobs.

During business hours, users may face long wait times due to heavy workloads already running.

Cluster utilization is not optimized across day/night cycles.

Admins sometimes have to manually reschedule jobs, which is inefficient.



---

Business Impact / Outcomes

Improved Cluster Throughput: Smaller/urgent jobs finish faster during peak hours.

Optimized Resource Utilization: Heavy jobs are automatically shifted to low-demand times (night, weekends, holidays).

Fairer Scheduling: Users experience reduced queue wait times for standard workloads.

Better Productivity: Researchers/engineers get results faster for urgent work.

Operational Efficiency: Admins spend less time managing job priorities manually.



---

Project Requirements

1. Enhance job submission to tag jobs as urgent vs. non-urgent/heavy.


2. Collect cluster load patterns (peak vs. off-peak usage).


3. Implement scheduling logic to defer heavy jobs to low-demand periods.


4. Ensure urgent jobs can override and run anytime.


5. Provide a dashboard/alerts for users to see expected start times.


6. Track and report improvements in queue wait times and throughput.

Estimated Effort

Week 1‚Äì2: Gather requirements, analyze cluster usage data.

Week 3‚Äì4: Define tagging mechanism for heavy vs. urgent jobs.

Week 5‚Äì6: Implement scheduling logic to prioritize light/urgent jobs in peak hours.

Week 7: Build dashboard to show queue optimization and predictions.

Week 8: Testing, validation, and integration with LSF environment.

üëâ This idea positions itself as fair scheduling & cluster optimization, while your first one was self-healing jobs. Both complement each other nicely.

Do you want me to also make a quick 2‚Äì3 sentence pitch version of this one (like something you can say in front of judges in <30 seconds)?
