Got it üëç You want a clear, simple write-up of your hackathon idea around predicting job failures in IBM LSF and automating fixes. Here‚Äôs a draft you can use directly for your submission:

Problem Statement

In large compute environments using IBM LSF, many jobs run for days or even weeks before failing due to known issues like misconfiguration, resource mismatch, or past unresolved errors. This wastes valuable compute time, delays project delivery, and frustrates end users.

Current Challenges

Long-running jobs fail after consuming large amounts of compute, storage, and time.

Failures often follow known patterns but are not proactively flagged.

End users may not know about previous fixes documented in internal wikis, vendor knowledge bases, or manuals.

Support teams spend time manually troubleshooting repeated issues.

Queues get overloaded with jobs that have a low chance of success.


Business Impact / Outcome

Reduced Compute Waste: By predicting failures early, we avoid running jobs that will likely fail.

Faster Issue Resolution: Automatic correlation with past issues and suggested fixes reduces time spent debugging.

Improved Productivity: Users and admins spend less time chasing recurring problems.

Smarter Scheduling: Jobs with low predicted success can be queued differently, flagged, or sent back to owners.

Cost Savings: Less wasted CPU/GPU cycles means more efficient use of infrastructure.


Project Requirements

1. Collect metadata from past LSF job runs (parameters, runtime, exit codes, logs).


2. Build a predictive model to estimate job success/failure before execution.


3. Pattern detection to match failures with known issues.


4. Integration with internal documentation, vendor KBs, and manuals to suggest fixes.


5. Provide a simple dashboard/notification system for flagged jobs.


6. Optionally allow auto-application of known safe fixes.



Estimated Effort

Week 1‚Äì2: Data gathering (job history, logs, error codes), requirement finalization.

Week 3‚Äì4: Build initial ML model for success/failure prediction.

Week 5‚Äì6: Develop failure pattern matching + documentation lookup.

Week 7‚Äì8: Integration with LSF workflow (flagging, notifications, dashboards).

Week 9 (Optional): Add auto-fix capability for well-known recurring issues.

Would you like me to also reframe this as a short, catchy pitch (2‚Äì3 sentences) so you can present it quickly during the hackathon intro?
