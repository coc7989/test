This is a fantastic idea 🙌 — an AI-powered conversational assistant for HPC/LSF environments that works differently for admins and users/designers. Judges will love this because it’s relatable (everyone struggles with cluster queries) and it shows clear time savings + productivity gains.

Here’s the full hackathon-ready write-up with extra queries/ideas added:

Topic Name

"AI Chatbot for HPC Simulations and Cluster Insights"


---

Problem Statement

In HPC (High Performance Computing) environments, both users (designers/researchers) and admins frequently need insights about jobs, queues, licenses, and resources. Currently, they rely on command-line queries, scripts, or manual documentation, which is time-consuming and not user-friendly. New users often struggle to find the right queue, optimal resources, or reasons for job failures, while admins spend a lot of time answering repeated queries.


---

Current Challenges

Users must learn complex LSF commands to check queue limits, SLA, or job status.

Admins spend time manually checking logs, utilization reports, and license usage.

Predictive insights (like upcoming load spikes or license bottlenecks) require manual analysis.

Lack of an easy, natural language interface slows down productivity and causes delays in troubleshooting.

Repeated questions (Why is my job pending? What is the best queue? How many licenses are free?) are answered manually over and over.



---

Business Impact / Outcomes

Time Savings: Users and admins get instant answers via chatbot instead of searching docs or running scripts.

Improved Productivity: Users get guidance on optimal resources and queues, reducing job failures.

Smarter Planning: Admins can run “what-if” scenarios (servers, licenses, simulations) for future planning.

Predictive Insights: Helps anticipate resource needs, peak loads, and license demand weeks in advance.

Accessibility: Even non-expert users can interact in plain English instead of technical commands.

Reduced Support Load: Admins handle fewer repetitive queries from users.

Example Capabilities

For Admins

“What if I add 10 more servers to the HPC?”

“What if I buy 100 extra licenses for ANSYS?”

“Predict cluster load if 1000 jobs are submitted on Friday.”

“Forecast next month’s peak load broken down by queue, tool, and license.”

“Show me the top 10 longest-running jobs this week.”

“List queues with >80% CPU usage in the last 24h.”

“Which license feature is the bottleneck most often?”

“How many jobs failed last week due to insufficient memory?”

“What is the average wait time per queue?”

“Which users are consuming the most resources this month?”


For Users/Designers

“Why is my job pending?”

“Why is my job getting killed?”

“What are my SLA and queue limits?”

“What is the optimal CPU and memory for simulation type X?”

“When is the best time to run 800 jobs?”

“Which queue is least loaded right now?”

“How many licenses of my tool are available?”

“Show me my top 5 longest jobs.”

“How many of my jobs failed in the last month and why?”

“Suggest the best configuration for faster turnaround.”

Project Requirements

1. Develop chatbot interface (web dashboard + API).


2. Connect chatbot with job history, LSF metrics, license usage, queue stats.


3. Implement natural language understanding (NLU) for queries.


4. Build admin & user dashboards with role-based access.


5. Integrate prediction models for load, license usage, and resource needs.


6. Provide troubleshooting & optimization suggestions for users.


7. Logging & feedback loop to continuously improve chatbot answers.

Estimated Effort

Week 1–2: Requirement gathering, data source integration (LSF logs, license servers, job history).

Week 3–4: Build chatbot MVP with basic Q&A (pending jobs, SLA, queue usage).

Week 5–6: Add predictive features (resource forecasts, load prediction).

Week 7–8: Implement admin “what-if” scenario capabilities.

Week 9: Role-based dashboards, testing, and deployment.

👉 This idea is powerful because it combines AI, NLP, predictive analytics, and HPC operations — all in one.

Would you like me to also draft a 30-second “elevator pitch” version for this chatbot idea (something short & catchy you can say to judges quickly)?





---

Estimated Effort

Week 1–2: Gather requirements, analyze cluster usage data.

Week 3–4: Define tagging mechanism for heavy vs. urgent jobs.

Week 5–6: Implement scheduling logic to prioritize light/urgent jobs in peak hours.

Week 7: Build dashboard to show queue optimization and predictions.

Week 8: Testing, validation, and integration with LSF environment.



---

👉 This idea positions itself as fair scheduling & cluster optimization, while your first one was self-healing jobs. Both complement each other nicely.

Do you want me to also make a quick 2–3 sentence pitch version of this one (like something you can say in front of judges in <30 seconds)?
