AutoInferno is a comprehensive portal designed to streamline license installation processes and more. This platform facilitates users in swiftly installing new licenses onto production servers with ease and efficiency.

Usability of the Portal:

Installing New Licenses:
Step 1: Navigate to the AutoInferno dashboard at autoinferno.com.
Step 2: Choose the vendor, server, operation, upload new license files (in txt format), and add any pertinent comments.
Step 3: Click the submit button to initiate the current request or the reset button to clear all selected fields.
Step 4: Upon submission, the existing license file is modified based on the selected options, generating an updated file as follows:

The first three lines (SERVER/USE_SERVER/DAEMON/VENDOR) remain unchanged.
For Merge requests, existing FEATURES remain intact, while new FEATURES are appended to the license file.
For Replace requests, all contents below the DAEMON line are removed, and FEATURES from the new license file are copied.
Step 5: Once the updated license file is generated, the portal displays a comparison of FEATURES between the existing and updated files on the dashboard.
Step 6: After verification, if users are unsatisfied with the comparison details, they can click the ABORT button to log and abort the current request.
Step 7: If users are satisfied, they can click the submit button to push the updated file to the production server.
